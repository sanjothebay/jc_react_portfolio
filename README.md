## Instructions

### Updated Portfolio

   Updated site should still have all of the content it previously had:

* Your name

* Links to your GitHub profile & LinkedIn page as well as your email address and phone number

* A link to a PDF of your resume with updated projects

* A list of projects. For each project, make sure you have the following:

  * Project title

  * Link to the deployed version

  * Link to the GitHub repository

  * GIF or screenshot of the deployed application


#### Design

* Mobile-first design

* color palette for your site so it doesn't just look like the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* font size is large enough to read, and that the colors don't cause eye strain.
